# Project Survivors

by fFukurou

### This is the sixth 2D game I make on Godot, and honestly I really went hard on this one.

### I basically implemented all the basic funtionality for the features I'd want to integrate in the future.

### I really liked coding and animating this one, with static 2D sprites, particles and shaders!

## Thank you for testing my game!
